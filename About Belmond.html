							<p>Bisong Belmond [BB] is an Accounting graduate, ACCA candidate and a CFA aspirant. His love for analysis and problem solving was the impetus for creating 
								this blog, where he applies his knowledge and skills to find answers and patterns from data.
								Upon graduation from the university of Buea in 2018. BB began his ACCA journey in late 2019 where he has performed greatly to date.
								BB plans on commencing his CFA journey after completing his ACCA journey. <p>

								BB is a inquisitive individual who has long being in love with numbers and critical thinking, reason why he crossed into the accountancy profession. While very good at Accounting,
								BB is more inclined towards management and financial analysis. BB's long-term plan is to become a financial analyst where he can help businesses and clients 
								make better financial decisions. His strong desire for knowledge and his self-taught nature has led him to undertake several learning journeys on his own, where he has learned a lot in 
								the field of data analytics so far. <p>
								
								BB is a seasoned Microsoft Excel user who has completed several online courses and projects on Excel. He recently started providing Excel training to university students after noticing 
								the great lack of soft skills among young graduates in Cameroon. Showcasing some of his Excel projects is the purpose of this blog, hoping that someone somewhere will be inspired too and 
								invest their time wisely in honing their skills while increasing their knowledge.<p>
								
								BB has also been learning the popular programming language <b>Python</b> for data analysis as well as <b>SQL</b> for querying and exploring data. This blog will also serve as a repository for Python and SQL projects.<p>
