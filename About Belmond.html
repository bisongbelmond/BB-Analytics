								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Portrait.jpg" alt="" /></span>Bisong Belmond [BB] is an Accounting graduate and ACCA candidate with a strong interest in Data Analytics. His love for analysis and problem solving was the impetus for creating 
									this blog, where he works on mini projects, applying his knowledge and skills to find answers and patterns from data using Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI and Tableau.

									</p>
								
							<p>BB is a inquisitive individual who has long being in love with numbers and critical thinking, reason why he crossed into the accountancy profession. While very good at Accounting,
								He is more inclined towards management and financial analysis and has long-term plans of becoming a financial analyst where he can help businesses and individuals 
								make better financial decisions. His strong desire for knowledge and his self-taught nature has led him to undertake several learning journeys on his own, where he has learned a lot in 
								the area of data analysis so far. </p>
								
							<p>BB is a seasoned Microsoft Excel user who has completed several online courses and projects on Excel. He has recently been learning the popular programming language <b>Python</b> for data analysis, <b>SQL</b> for querying and exploration as well as <b>Power BI</b> and <b>Tableau</b> for visualising data. 
								<!--He recently started providing Excel training to university students and friends after noticing the great lack in soft skills among young graduates in Cameroon.--> Showcasing some of his Data Analysis projects is the purpose of this blog, hoping that many will be inspired and invest their time wisely in honing their skills while growing in knowledge.<p>
								
								<!--</p>
								BB has also been learning the popular programming language <b>Python</b> for data analysis, <b>SQL</b> for querying and exploration as well as <b>Power BI</b> and <b>Tableau</b> for visualising data. 
								This blog will equally serve as a repository for Python, SQL, Power BI and Tableau projects.<p>-->
